## About this project
The yacht-dice game implemented through the CLI.

## Overview
- I was impressed by the project that implemented Tetris using the command line interface.
- The main goal is to implement **GUI games** with **CLI**.
- Make sure that the terminal font is fixed width.
- I tried to reduce the installation of additional packages as much as possible.
- This is a light toy project.
- The convention follows PEP 8, but inevitably there are lines over 80 characters.
- Please use python3.
- If you use ssh, etc., there may be breaks.
